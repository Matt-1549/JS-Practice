<!-- Lesson 1: Intro to JS -->

<!-- Step 1 -->
<!-- Create a basic HTML page with a header called "My Opinon on X", a paragraph, an image. The content of the HTML page should be about an opinion - Yes or No. -->

<DOCTYPE !html>

<head>

<body>

 <h1>
   My thoughts on having pinapple on pizza 
 </h1>

  <div>


  <p id="opinion">

    Here is why I like pinapple on pizza:

    <br>The pinapple carmelizes
    <br>The pinapple is yellow
    <br>The pinapple tastes nice


    
  </p>

    <button onclick='document.getElementById("opinion").innerHTML = "PINAPPLE IS BAD BECUASE IT TASTES BAD"'>Change my opinion</button>

    
  </div>


  

<!-- Step 2 -->
<!-- Create 2 buttons that says "Change my opinion 1/2" -->

<!-- Step 3 -->
<!-- When you click that button, change the contents of the paragraph to the opposite opinion-->



<!-- Step 4 -->
<!-- When you click the next button, change the image to match your opinion-->

<!-- Step 5 -->
<!-- Add styles to your elements in style.css -->

<!-- Step 6 -->
<!-- Create two buttons: Theme 1 and Theme 2 -->

<!-- Step 7 -->
<!-- When you click Theme 1 and Theme 2, change a certain style in your page-->

<!-- After all of this, do you notice a limitation about every time we make a button and try to change something? -->
